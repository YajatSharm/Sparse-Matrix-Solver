This assignment required the creation of a sparse matrix solver that reads a Matrix Market file
and converts the data into Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format. This CSR data is then used
to solve the matrix using a sparse matrix solving algorithm. The accuracy of the algorithm is
measured through the norm of the residual vector that is found by comparing the value that the
matrix produces for the solved values of x and the given result it should produce.
Additionally, tools like Vtune have been used to breakdown the performance of the code into
separate sections. The matrix sparsity pattern was plotted using python
